warchief combat prototype

to test this download latest files of warchief

then open main.lua and change last line(line 15) 

from

composer.gotoScene("menu")


to

composer.gotoScene("Combat")



and run, it should run combat scene straight away

test by pressing attack key on screen

you will see health bars working

also if any of them dies , it just prints game over

so you have to relaunch to test again.

you can change enemy and player stats around to change
the tide ;D

keep in mind this is a prototype not a finished product.
thanks
